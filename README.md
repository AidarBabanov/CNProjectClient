This is a project for Computer Networks course. Aim of the project is to learn basic knowledge about networking. Task inside the project and called "CS233-Proj1.pdf". We did this task in pairs. Contributors: [Aidar Babanov](https://github.com/AidarBabanov) and [Serik Zhilibayev](https://github.com/Zhilibayev).   

We had to create P2P (Peer-to-Peer) aplication for sending files between wto users (Similar to Napster). 

This is client side. User searches for necessary files and then downloads from another user. Includes GUI. Partially ended(user have to change some directories manually in code).
